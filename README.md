## Building
Pylet can be built using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/) alongside the [Qt5 framework](http://www.qt.io/download/). CMake 2.8.11 is the minimum version required for properly configuring the project. For Windows and OSX, ensure that the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable references the desired Qt directory (i.e. C:\Qt\5.5\msvc2013\).
